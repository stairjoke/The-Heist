# The-Heist
A simple game made with Unity where you collect gems and defend yourself against robots.

The first version available here in Github is the result of a class I took in college, this game was the byproduct of getting to know Unity. Thst's this repos initial commit. Further commits were experiments based on this code in trying out Unity for iOS development.

You can play the initial commit built for web, just keep in mind it's a "hello-world" kind of game: https://wmassag.github.io/The-Heist/
