# The-Heist
A simple game made with Unity where you collect gems and defend yourself against robots.

The first version available here in Github is the result of a class I took in college, this game was the byproduct of getting to know Unity. Further development is part of a new course I’m taking right now (10/2017).

The current goal is to clean up the code and design with iPad as a target. This project is meant to be used for learning by doing, you will not find sophisticated code, for the time being.

## Known Issues
+ UI Button to start the game and to restart the does not properly scale and position. Works only in 1080p 16:9
