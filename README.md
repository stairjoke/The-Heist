# The-Heist
A simple game made with Unity where you collect gems and defend yourself against robots.

The first version available here in Github is the result of a class I took in college, this game was the byproduct of getting to know Unity. Further development is part of a new course I’m taking right now (10/2017).

The current goal is to clean up the code and design with iPad as a target. This project is meant to be used for learning by doing, it’s a work in progress prototype (coding style: “Mac Gyver”-ing it together).
